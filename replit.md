### Technical Implementations
- **Core Components**: Includes CycleOverview (main dashboard), CageDetail (individual cage management), Analytics (performance metrics), and CageManager (creation/management).
- **Calculations**: Provides utilities for feed conversion ratios, laying percentages, efficiency metrics, and comprehensive financial calculations (e.g., ROI).
- **Data Flow**: User input is immediately saved to IndexedDB, triggering real-time UI updates, on-demand analytics processing, and Chart.js rendering.
- **Daily Entry System**: Redesigned for cage-level entry of mortality and egg production, with cycle-level tracking for feed consumption and birds sold. Auto-calculates flock age and opening birds.
- **Sales and Expense Management**: Dual-tab system for tracking egg and bird sales, and categorized expense recording. Features comprehensive filtering by category and sales type.
- **Vaccination Management**: Comprehensive tracking with user-configurable schedules and automatic flock age calculation.
- **CSV Import/Export**: Bidirectional data transfer for production logs, sales, expenses, and feed logs, optimized for Excel compatibility with template downloads and smart import that auto-creates missing cycles/cages.
- **Analytics Enhancements**: Time period filtering (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly), daily metric granularity, and secondary Y-axes for percentage-based metrics in charts. Handles various data field formats for compatibility.
