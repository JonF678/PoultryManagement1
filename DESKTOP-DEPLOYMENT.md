# üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed!
1. The package.json dependency issue has been resolved. Electron and electron-builder are now properly installed as devDependencies.
2. The electron version detection issue has been fixed by adding explicit electronVersion in electron-builder.json.
3. Configuration automatically updated with the correct Electron version (37.2.5).

## Quick Start

### Test Desktop App (Development Mode)
```bash
npx electron electron/main.js
```

### Build Desktop Installers

**For your current platform:**
```bash
npx electron-builder --config electron-builder.json
```

**For specific platforms:**
```bash
# Windows installer (.exe) - run this on Windows
npx electron-builder --win --config electron-builder.json

# macOS disk image (.dmg) - only works on macOS
npx electron-builder --mac --config electron-builder.json

# Linux AppImage and .deb - run this on Linux
npx electron-builder --linux --config electron-builder.json
```

**Platform Restrictions:**
- Windows builds: Only on Windows machines
- macOS builds: Only on macOS machines  
- Linux builds: Only on Linux machines
- Cross-platform building requires Docker or CI services

**Quick Windows Build:**
```batch
# On Windows, use the batch file
build-windows.bat
```

## What You'll Get

After building, check the `dist/` folder for:

- **Windows**: `Poultry Manager Setup.exe` (installer)
- **macOS**: `Poultry Manager.dmg` (disk image)
- **Linux**: `Poultry Manager.AppImage` and `Poultry Manager.deb`

## Desktop Features

Your desktop app includes these enhancements over the web version:

### Native Integration
- File dialogs for CSV imports
- Save dialogs for exports  
- System notifications
- Native application menus
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+I for import, Ctrl+E for export)

### Performance Benefits
- No browser overhead
- Faster load times
- Better resource management
- Fully offline capability

### Enhanced Functionality
- Automatic backups to custom locations
- Print support for reports
- Native window management
- Platform-specific styling

## Installation Process

1. **Build the installer** using the commands above
2. **Locate the installer** in the `dist/` folder
3. **Run the installer** on your target computer
4. **Launch** like any other desktop application

## Distribution

- Share installer files from `dist/` folder
- Users install normally on Windows/Mac/Linux  
- No internet connection required to run
- All existing data and features preserved

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Ensure Node.js and npm are installed
- Run `npm install` if missing dependencies
- Check that all files are present in project directory
- If you get "cannot compute electron version" error, run: `node build-fix.js`
- The electronVersion is now explicitly set in electron-builder.json

### Runtime Issues  
- The app loads your existing PWA in an Electron window
- All web technologies (IndexedDB, localStorage) work normally
- Check console for any JavaScript errors
