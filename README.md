---

## All Calculations Explained

### 1. **Laying Percentage (Production Rate)**
```
Laying Rate = (Eggs Collected ÷ Current Birds) × 100
```
**Example**: 80 eggs from 100 birds = 80% laying rate
**What it means**: Percentage of your birds that laid eggs today

### 2. **Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR)**
```
FCR = Total Feed Consumed (kg) ÷ Total Egg Weight (kg)
```
**Example**: 10kg feed for 8kg eggs = FCR of 1.25
**What it means**: How much feed needed to produce 1kg of eggs (lower is better)

### 3. **Feed Efficiency**
```
Feed Efficiency = Total Egg Weight (kg) ÷ Total Feed Consumed (kg)
```
**Example**: 8kg eggs from 10kg feed = 0.8 efficiency
**What it means**: How much egg weight you get from 1kg of feed (higher is better)

### 4. **Mortality Rate**
```
Mortality Rate = (Total Deaths ÷ Initial Birds) × 100
```
**Example**: 5 deaths from 100 birds = 5% mortality rate
**What it means**: Percentage of birds that have died since cycle start

### 5. **Hen House Production**
```
Hen House Production = Total Eggs ÷ Average Birds ÷ Days in Production
```
**Only counts days after 19 weeks of age (when laying typically starts)**
**What it means**: Average eggs per bird per day during laying period

### 6. **Feed per Bird per Day**
```
Daily Feed per Bird = Total Feed (kg) ÷ Current Birds
```
**Example**: 10kg feed for 100 birds = 0.1kg per bird per day
**What it means**: How much feed each bird consumes daily

### 7. **Feed per Egg**
```
Feed per Egg = Daily Feed (kg) ÷ Eggs Collected × 1000
```
**Result in grams per egg**
**Example**: 10kg feed for 80 eggs = 125g feed per egg
**What it means**: How much feed is used to produce one egg

### 8. **Performance Score**
```
Performance Score = (Laying Rate × 0.6) + (Feed Efficiency × 10 × 0.4)
```
**Example**: 80% laying rate + 0.8 feed efficiency = (80 × 0.6) + (8 × 0.4) = 51.2 points
**What it means**: Overall cage performance rating out of 100

### 9. **Profit Calculation**
```
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
ROI = (Profit ÷ Total Expenses) × 100
```
**Example**: ₵5000 revenue - ₵3000 expenses = ₵2000 profit (67% ROI)
**What it means**: How much money you made after all costs

### 10. **Break-Even Point**
```
Break-Even = Fixed Costs ÷ (Price per Egg - Variable Cost per Egg)
```
**What it means**: How many eggs you need to sell to cover all costs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### **"No data showing in analytics"**
- Make sure you have recorded daily production data
- Check that you have sales and expense records
- Verify your cycle has active cages

#### **"Calculations seem wrong"**
- Ensure all daily entries are complete
- Check that bird counts are accurate
- Verify feed amounts are in kilograms

#### **"Performance scores are low"**
- Review laying rates - may need better nutrition
- Check feed efficiency - might need feed adjustment
- Consider bird health and vaccination status

#### **"App not working offline"**
- Ensure you've opened the app online at least once
- Check if service worker is installed
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Getting Help:
1. Check this README for explanations
